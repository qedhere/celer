### Contents
In this document we will discuss the creation of Celer, and the process of creating a new project. The article is broadly divided into the following sections:

1. **Investigation**: What is the problem we are trying to solve? What is the motivation behind this project?

2. **Preparation**: What are the tools we are going to use? What are the requirements for the project?

3. **Action**: What are the steps we are going to take to create the project? How can we efficiently achieve our goals?

4. **Reflection**: What did we learn from this project? What are the lessons we can take away from this project?

5. **Demonstration**: What is the end result of this project? How can we show the results of our work?

With all that said, let's dive right in!

## Investigation

What was the motivation behind this project? Speaking from the perspective of a student who is studying in an online school, communication with others is
one of the most important aspects of the learning experience. What not a better way than using a platform that is designed for communication?

I'm going to be completely honest with you, I'm not a huge fan of the Adobe Connect Chat. It's a general purpose tool, which get's the job done for most classes, however, often not
enough. Consider the following:

<Image src="/reflection/adobe-chat.png" width={2000} height={800} />

As we can see the formatting, is by all means not perfect. It's difficult to read, and not very user friendly. For context, here is a screenshot of the same message(s) rendered using Celer.

$$
\text{hello chat}
$$

$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2 \longrightarrow 6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

$$
\displaystyle \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

## Preparation
With this goal in mind, I started to plan out how I might go about impleting this in a feasible way. I started by looking at the tools I had at my disposal. I had a few options:

1. Create a plugin for Adobe Connect.
  * **<span className="text-success-300">Pros:</span>**
    - User friendly.
  * **<span className="text-red-500">Cons:</span>**
    - The Adobe Connect platform is not open source.
    - Plugins are poorly documented.
    - Plugins have to be approved by Adobe.
2. Create an external embeddable chat widget.
  * **<span className="text-success-300">Pros:</span>**
    - Open source.
    - Easy to implement.
    - Highly customizable.
  * **<span className="text-red-500">Cons:</span>**
    - No access to Adobe Connect API.

I decided to go with the second option, as it was the most feasible.  

## Action
For the project, I had the following requirements:

1. Built for speed, and efficiency. Low latency is a must.
2. Easy to use, and intuitive.
3. Support for LaTeX, Markdown, MhChem and Raw HTML.

With the recent release of Next.js 13, I decided to use it as the framework for the project. Here is speed comparison between the frameworks I had in mind:

As for the backend, I decided to use Firebase. Firebase is a cloud platform that provides a variety of services, including a realtime database, authentication, and hosting. I used Firebase because it is easy to use, and has a free tier.
